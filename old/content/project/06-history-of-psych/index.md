Check out my brief history of personality on the EJP Personality Psychology Podcast: https://personalitypsychologypodcast.com/blog/

For me, anything in personality always starts with the question of what personality is. In the earliest days of my own training as an academic psychologist, I was never told what personality was and instead challenged to figure it out. When I surveyed contemporary research, I found the dominant between-person trait approaches unsatisfactory for explaining what personality truly is. So instead, I deeply invested in learning the history of personality, trying to get a sense of where the field had been to see where it could go. 

What I found is that personality psychology has a rich history. Modern personality has its roots in the earliest days of empirical psychology and differential approaches, with work by Heymans in the Netherlands. From there, personality came to the United States, where Gordon Allport's early work on idiographic versus nomothetic approaches earning him the nickname of the father of personality. Despite this, Allport's seminal text on personality was published in 1937, which was the same year that Ross Stagner published his seminal text in personality. These two texts, despite being published the same year, presented very different pictures of personality, with Allport justifying the field's existence and Stagner taking it as a given.  

Beyond this, the rest of the 20th century saw the rise of traits as the unit of personality, the rise of the consistency paradox, the Person-Situation Debate, the Big Five, and the study of change. At the same time, personality seemingly sort of forgot about idiographic approaches until the 21st century, when the study of within-person variability brought it back to the fore.  

For me, the deeper I get into the history of personality, the more key, untested questions I find, like how do you measure and model a person? When and how can personality cause behavior and experiences? Is personality best considered an open system? Do we need personality traits in a theory of personality?
