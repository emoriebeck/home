Idiographic modeling -- or person-centered descriptive, predictive, and explanatory statistical models -- in personality has a deep history. From the earliest days of the development of modeling techniques in personality, like factor analysis, researchers like Raymond Cattell were actively engaged with adapting such methods for idiographic use. Despite the development of such methods, data collection techniques lagged behind, which has hindered idiographic modeling development.  

In my research, I apply approaches from economics, clinical psychology, and computer science, like basic ARIMA, vector autoregression, and machine learning approaches (e.g., L1 and L2 regularization, random forest, etc.) to time series of idiographic data. With such approaches, I can describe core features of an individual, predict consequential behaviors and outcomes, and work toward explaining the processes through which behaviors and experiences unfold.
