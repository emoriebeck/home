bio: My research focuses around the question of what personality is. Definitions have big consequences for how we measure personality, what those measures predict both short- and long-term, how personality is thought to change, and more. One way of doing differentiating definitions is through levels of aggregation. Thus, I study how to understand the personality of an individual relative to only themself, relative to some others, and relative to all others. To do so, I use a mix of methods, including experience sampling methods, passive sensing, survey data, panel data, cognitive tests, and more measured across time intervals from moments to years. I model these data with an array of statistical approaches, including time series analysis, multilevel / hierarchical modeling, machine learning, network psychometrics, structural equation modeling, and more.

I am a personality psychologist. My research focuses on the what's, how's, and why's of personality at different levels of aggregations and at different time spans. I am strongly versed in a number of quantitative methods.
