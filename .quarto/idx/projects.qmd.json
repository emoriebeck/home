Much work on understanding personality involves taking a standard battery of questions and administering them to participants one time. More recently, personality researchers have turned to the experience sampling method in order to capture small slices of individuals’ daily behaviors and experiences. To do so, researchers generally take the same standard batteries meant to describe personality in general and change the wording to make sense in daily life (e.g., “I am often outgoing” becomes “I am outgoing”). However, participants frequently report that (1) these items aren’t applicable in their daily lives or (2) fail to assess things that are actually applicable to their daily lives. This study aims to understand which and how unique experiences unfold in participants’ everyday life. \n\nData collection for this study are ongoing. The preregistration of the data collection can be found here: \n\n**Aim 1: Determining unique content of daily life**\nParticipants will be prompted to describe their typical thoughts, feelings, behaviors, and experiences. Then, from this, they’ll be asked to generate a list of 15-20 things (or cardinal states) they think are most important to be assessed to understand their everyday experiences. \n\n**Aim 2: The utility of unique content of daily life**\nParticipants uniquely provided items will be provided to them in experience sampling method surveys sent to them via text message five times per day for three weeks. In addition, we will have them respond to standard personality batteries and report contextual information (e.g., in class). \n\n**Planned studies **\nSeparate pre-registrations linked to the study pre-registration will be submitted for each: \n-\tItem content of unique items\n-\tPredicting outcomes (e.g., loneliness, procrastination, studying) using unique v shared items\n-\tPsychometric properties of unique items\n-\tAssociation among emotions, emotion regulation strategies, and emotion regulation goals using change as outcome or other systems models\n-\tUsing people’s free response as folk theories of their own behavior and testing their accuracy\n-\tDo person-specific models out-predict hybrid and group-level models in predicting momentary behaviors / experiences\n\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"output-file":"projects.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","csl":"apa-cv.csl","bibliography":["mybib.bib"],"editor":"visual","theme":"cosmo","title":"Projects"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
